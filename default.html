      Tarot is a 2024 American supernatural horror film written and 
      directed by Spenser Cohen and Anna Halberg in their feature film directorial debuts. 
      It is based on the 1992 novel Horrorscope by Nicholas Adams. 
      The film stars Harriet Slater, Adain Bradley, Avantika, Wolfgang Novogratz, Humberly González, Larsen Thompson, Olwen Fouéré, and Jacob Batalon. 
      The story follows a group of college students who, 
      after using a strange Tarot deck, begin to gruesomely die one by one and must uncover the deck’s mystery before time runs out.
      Tarot was released in the United States by Sony Pictures Releasing on May 3, 2024. 
      The film received generally negative reviews from critics but was a box office success, grossing $49.1 million worldwide over a budget of $8 million.
